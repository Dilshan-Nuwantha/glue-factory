    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a LightGlue model directly on your HPatches images:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Mounts Google Drive and accesses your HPatches dataset\n",
    "2. ✅ Extracts all images from HPatches sequences\n",
    "3. ✅ Trains LightGlue using synthetic homographies on your images\n",
    "4. ✅ Evaluates the trained model\n",
    "5. ✅ Saves the trained model to Google Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Details:**\n",
    "- **Dataset:** Your HPatches images (~5000 image pairs)\n",
    "- **Method:** Synthetic homographies for data augmentation\n",
    "- **Model:** LightGlue with SuperPoint features\n",
    "- **Epochs:** 30 (adjustable)\n",
    "- **Batch Size:** 16 (for free Colab GPU)\n",
    "- **Time:** ~2-3 hours on Colab T4 GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- Trained model weights in Google Drive\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics (homography error, matching accuracy)\n",
    "- Training logs and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Use the trained model for your own image matching tasks\n",
    "- Adjust hyperparameters for better performance\n",
    "- Evaluate on other datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**References:**\n",
